## Solitaire Card Game ##

Implementation of Solitaire using Java.

There are currently two 'working' game modes.<br>
1. Standard Mode <br>
Your standard game of solitaire.
2. Computer Mode <br>
The computer simulates a game so you can sit back and watch.<br>
The implementation is still basic and so doesn't quite work as it should (e.g. it's only capable of moving one card from a pile rather than a whole stack).
